# Consolidate Services Page & Fix Nav

## Problem
The Services dropdown submenu in the nav can't be clicked properly. Instead of fixing the dropdown, we'll simplify by making Services a single page and removing the submenu entirely.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Merge specialized services content into `services.html` as a new section
- [x] 2. Remove the cross-link section ("Need something more targeted?" / retainers) from services.html since it's all on one page now
- [x] 3. Update nav on ALL HTML files: replace the dropdown with a simple Services link
- [x] 4. Update mobile nav on ALL HTML files: remove Specialized Services and Retainers sub-links
- [x] 5. Update footer on ALL HTML files: simplify Services section
- [x] 6. Clean up dropdown CSS from styles.css
