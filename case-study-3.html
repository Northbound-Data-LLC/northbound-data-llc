          <h2>The Client</h2>
          <p>A B2B SaaS company in the HR tech space, post-Series A with $8M in ARR and growing fast. They had product-market fit and needed to instrument their business for scale—but had zero data infrastructure beyond basic product analytics.</p>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>The company had reached the point where spreadsheets and manual reporting weren't cutting it. The CFO needed reliable metrics for board meetings and investor updates. The VP of Operations needed pipeline and capacity data to plan hiring. The product team needed usage analytics. Everyone was asking the same question: "Where do we get good data?"</p>
          <p>They had the raw ingredients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Postgres production database with all their product data</li>
            <li>Salesforce for CRM</li>
            <li>Stripe for billing</li>
            <li>A newly provisioned Snowflake account</li>
            <li>A new data engineer, fresh from bootcamp, excited but inexperienced</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What they didn't have was any idea how to put it all together. They'd seen dbt mentioned everywhere and knew they should use it, but didn't know where to start. The VP of Operations put it simply: "We don't want to end up like our last company, where the data was a disaster. We want to do this right from the beginning."</p>

          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <h3>Phase 1: Discovery & Design (Weeks 1-2)</h3>
          <p>We started by understanding what the business actually needed to know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Workshops with stakeholders across Finance, Product, Sales, and Customer Success</li>
            <li>Identified the 20-30 core metrics that would drive the business</li>
            <li>Mapped data sources and evaluated ingestion options</li>
            <li>Designed the overall architecture and project structure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This upfront investment paid off. By understanding the business context first, we could design models that actually matched how people thought about the business—not just how the data happened to be structured in source systems.</p>

          <h3>Phase 2: Foundation Build (Weeks 3-7)</h3>
          <p>We built the core infrastructure layer by layer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data ingestion:</strong> Set up Fivetran connectors for Postgres, Salesforce, and Stripe</li>
            <li><strong>Staging layer:</strong> Clean, tested models for all source tables with consistent naming and typing</li>
            <li><strong>Intermediate layer:</strong> Business logic for complex joins and transformations</li>
            <li><strong>Mart layer:</strong> Final models organized by domain (customers, subscriptions, usage, pipeline)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every model included tests and documentation from the start. We weren't going to let technical debt accumulate from day one.</p>

          <h3>Phase 3: Metrics & Dashboards (Weeks 6-9)</h3>
          <p>With the foundation in place, we built out the reporting layer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented key SaaS metrics: MRR, ARR, churn, LTV, CAC, NDR</li>
            <li>Built cohort analysis capabilities for customer retention</li>
            <li>Created product usage models for feature adoption tracking</li>
            <li>Connected everything to Metabase for self-service exploration</li>
            <li>Built an executive dashboard with the metrics that mattered for board meetings</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 4: Enablement & Handoff (Weeks 8-10)</h3>
          <p>The most important part: making sure the team could own it going forward.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Paired extensively with the new data engineer on patterns and practices</li>
            <li>Created comprehensive documentation and a contribution guide</li>
            <li>Set up CI/CD with automated testing on every PR</li>
            <li>Established code review workflows and quality standards</li>
            <li>Built runbooks for common operations and troubleshooting</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Challenge</h2>
          <p>The trickiest part was defining metrics for a business still figuring itself out. SaaS metrics like NDR and churn seem straightforward until you hit edge cases: what counts as a "customer" when you have free trials, pilot programs, and enterprise contracts with different billing cadences? We built the metric layer with explicit handling of these edge cases and documented every decision, so the team could revisit definitions as the business model evolved without rebuilding from scratch.</p>

          <h2>The Outcome</h2>
          <p>The company launched their board meeting with confidence for the first time:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>60 production models covering all key business domains</li>
            <li>100% test coverage from day one—no data quality surprises</li>
            <li>Ad-hoc questions that used to take days now answered in hours</li>
            <li>Self-service analytics available for the first time</li>
            <li>A junior data engineer who could confidently extend the project</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            "We went into our Series B board meetings with actual data for the first time. Not spreadsheets someone pulled together at midnight—real, trustworthy metrics that we could drill into. The investors noticed."
            <footer>— VP of Operations</footer>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The VP of Operations estimated the engagement paid for itself within two months through eliminated manual reporting time and the ability to confidently present metrics to investors during their Series B process.</p>
          <p>18 months later, the company has grown the project to 150+ models, hired two more analysts, and still maintains the patterns and standards we established. They continue with a 10-hour monthly retainer for architecture guidance as they scale.</p>
